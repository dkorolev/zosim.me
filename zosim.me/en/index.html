      <h1>Welcome to Paradise Landscaping</h1>
      <p>Landscaping isnâ€™t just a profession to Vladimir, it is a main priority and passion. His interest for landscaping began in Germany, back in 1994, where he was first introduced to the trait. For two years, Vladimir traveled between Russia and Germany, where he gained training and experience. His training covered general and landscape irrigation systems, drip systems installation and maintenance, and building waterfalls and ponds from start to finish. After moving to America, Vladimir was able to open his own company and has attained over 20 years of experience. One exceptional trait about Vladimir work is that all of his projects are guaranteed and maintained for a year at no additional cost.</p>

          <p>Couple words about working with residential areas, what includes in design project, how long does it take, at what point Vladimir can do the job - at the moment of building and planning or later, when the building is built. Pros and cons of both ways. </p>

          <h1 class="section-title">Commercial Lands</h1>
          <p>There once was a story about a man who could turn invisible. I thought it was only a story... until it happened to me. Ok, so here's how it works: there's this stuff called Quicksilver that can bend light. Some scientist made it into a synthetic gland, and that's where I came in. </p>
